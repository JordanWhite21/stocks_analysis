# Green Stocks

## Overview of Project: The purpose of the analysis
#### Steve wanted to look at the data that would provide the best information for his parents when it came to investing into the stock market. He wanted to make sure that they were investing wisely and not throwing money away. To do this, he needed to look at some past stock data and see how these companies have done in the past. We were able to take the raw data that Steve had and transform it into something that is easy to read and really helpful when making a decision. While using VBA in excel, we were able to provide an easy to use program to find the information he needed so he can help out his parents. 

## What are the results?
### 2017 Data
#### Running the VBA on both the data sets for 2017 and 2018, you can see a very different differnce between the two years. During the 2017 year, the data shows that 11 companies had a postive return on the year, one company almost hit 200%! During the 2017 year, DQ did have a very good year with a return of 199.4%, and on the other hand, TERP had a loss of 7.2%. If Steve only looked at 2017, he would think that DQ was a very safe and profitable choice for his parents to invest in. You can see in the photo below, the data for the companies he was looking at.

### 2018 Data
#### During 2018, there was a very different story. Only two companies had a postive return, ENPH and RUN. Unforunately, DQ had a loss of 62.6% which is a 262% swing over one year. This would not end well for Steve's parents. Instead, Steve should be looking at suggesting ENPH to his parents. During 2017, you can see that ENPH had a return of 129.5%, which is the thrid highest return for a company on this list. During 2018, ENPH had the highest return with 81.9%. You can see the data below of all of the companies looked at.

### Overall analysis
#### Overall, looking at this data using VBA really helps break up the data set and makes it easier to digest. When you include buttons within your code, as you can see below, it makes it easier to share your files with people and have them understand what is going on. Steve should use this file to run the code and help his parents understand which stocks would be best for them to invest in.

## Summary
### Advantages or disadvantages?
#### There is a big advantage for refactoring code due to the maintainability. You are able to go back after legnths of time and easily find what you need and make changes as needed as well. You will know what you are looking at and what you are looking for and make those changes. It will also improve thethe system's maintainablility and enhance the performance. In addition, you will be able to scale your code as needed as well. Unfortuantely, a disadvantage could be that it is time conusming. You might not know how long it will take to make changes and updates.
